Map is a SUMO env with different elements. It consists of signalized and unsignalized intersections, merge-in and merge-out scenarios, along with a highway that simulates a simple city structure that is made into a closed-loop
It is created to perform DIAYN-style skill discovery training and evaluation. This work builds on the paper called "Developing Driving Strategies Efficiently: A Skill-Based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach" which uses a custom gym environment. The main purpose is to scale the environment and observe skill discovery and transfer in different settings in traffic.
